# Hi, I'm Pawesi Siantika 

Backend Engineer focused on scalable systems, Clean Architecture, and production-ready architecture.

I design and build backend systems that are reliable, observable, and ready for real-world operations — not just CRUD demos.

---

## What I Build

- Scalable REST APIs with clear domain boundaries  
- Clean Architecture & use-case driven backend systems  
- Asynchronous processing pipelines (worker-based architecture)  
- Production-ready deployments (Docker, reverse proxy, security hardening)  
- Observability stack (metrics, structured logs, monitoring dashboards)  
- Hardware-integrated backend systems (IoT → API → Dashboard)

---

## Featured Projects

### 🚗 Carwash Management System
Operational backend platform integrating IoT ticket dispenser, cashier application, and owner dashboard.

**Highlights:**
- Clean Architecture implementation (domain, application, infrastructure separation)
- Role-based access control (admin / cashier)
- Ticket lifecycle & fraud-control tracking
- Dockerized deployment behind reverse proxy
- Cloudflare protection & rate limiting

### 🧬 Jelajah Medika API
Backend service for molecule–protein interaction prediction using asynchronous job processing.

**Highlights:**
- Async worker architecture (API + job queue model)
- Trackable job lifecycle (queued → processing → completed/failed)
- Structured response schema for downstream integration
- Observability-ready (metrics & logging stack)
- Containerized deployment
